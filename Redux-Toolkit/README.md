# Redux Toolkit

## ✅ What is Redux?

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications (commonly used with React) that allows you to manage a global state in a predictable way.

## ✅ This means:

* You can store application-wide state (like user info, UI settings, etc.) in a central store.

* Any component in the React tree can access or update this global state, regardless of its depth or position, by connecting to the store (usually via useSelector and useDispatch in React Redux).
